# 🧠💰 Twin Pulse

AI Guardian for Smart Spending & Focus

Twin Pulse is a web-based AI system that protects users from impulse purchases and productivity collapse by managing willpower at decision time — not after damage is done.

# 🚨 Problem

People regret purchases and lose focus due to fatigue, emotion, and overstimulation

Finance apps track spending after money is gone

Productivity apps track tasks without understanding mental state

No system connects financial and focus decisions

👉 The real problem: Decision-making fails under low willpower.

# 💡 Solution

Twin Pulse uses context-aware AI to intervene before:

A bad purchase is made

Focus breaks and productivity drops

It treats money and productivity as one behavioral problem.
